Therefore, once a cell is run, its results are _persistent_, at least until we reset them. One big red button is the __Restart__ command under the _Kernel_ tab in the menu: it clears all memory of whatever was done in the cell so far (though obviously not file operations). Later in this notebook we show an example of the trouble persistence can cause.\n","\n","### Indentation\n","Indentation is crucial: in a `for` loop, an `if` block, or a function definition, the inner part __MUST__ be indented consistently.

You can write `if a == 4` but not `if a = 4`. Also, writing the statement `a = 4` is correct, and so is `a == 4`; however, the latter has no effect (apart from returning `True` or `False` on the Python command line).\n","\n","### Semicolons, be gone!\n","You may have noticed that Python doesn't require semicolons (`;`) at the end of each instruction, as other languages like C, C++, Java, AMPL do.
